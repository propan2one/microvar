# MicroVar 

A very basic analysis pipeline for genomic analysis. Consider using [nfcore pipelines](https://nf-co.re/) for real projects, the code here is available for research and educational purposes.

## Introduction

The aim of this pipeline is to put the nextflow framework to the test in the context of 3rd and 4th generation pipeline utilization (see [blogpost](https://jeandelmotte.com/posts/bioinformatics-generation/)).
